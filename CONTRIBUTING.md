We love hearing from the community and appeciate the desire to improve the project!

You may suggest a feature enhancement, a new design for a feature, or even a completely new feature!

We believe in the Unix philosophy:

> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

We try to keep our API lean and easy-to-use. For this reason, we may decide against including a new feature.
